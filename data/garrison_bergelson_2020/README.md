2. Abstract
Infants amass thousands of hours of experience with particular items, each of which is representative of a broader category that often shares perceptual features. Robust word comprehension requires generalizing known labels to new category members. While young infants have been found to look at common nouns when they are named aloud, the role of item familiarity has not been well examined. This study compares 12- to 18-month-oldsâ€™ word comprehension in the context of pairs of their own items (e.g., photographs of their own shoe and ball) versus new tokens from the same category (e.g., a new shoe and ball). Our results replicate previous work showing that noun comprehension improves rapidly over the second year, while also suggesting that item familiarity appears to play a far smaller role in comprehension in this age range. This in turn suggests that even before age 2, ready generalization beyond particular experiences is an intrinsic component of lexical development.

3. Original study info
35 children were tested -- 5 were excluded in the paper on the basis of less than half of trials (<16) with valid data (see paper/their osf for trial-level exclusions)
Trials were either own item (images from the parents of actual objects in the kids life) or other item (i.e same samed object, but not the childs) 
Parents were given a list of 26 options, and provided 12, this was then selected down to 8 based on image clarity and trying to pair for different consonant onset and not mix animacy. 
32 test trials: 4 x 8 target nouns (2 own, 2 other). Pairings were always consistent. 


4. Importing decisions
aoi regions were not recalculated; trial-level exclusions and looking regions taken from processed  data (post garrison's processing script)

image_description in stimuli collapses some labels, but collapsing with ad-hoc
