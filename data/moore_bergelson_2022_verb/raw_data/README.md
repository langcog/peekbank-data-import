# Raw data

The data is raw in the sense that it isn't aggregated. It has been preprocessed though: SR Research Data Viewer was used to create fixation and message reports (not included here) which were then preprocessed in `vna_dataprep.Rmd` (which is included) creating files in `data/eyetracking` (included).
