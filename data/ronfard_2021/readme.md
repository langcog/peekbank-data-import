2. **Abstract.** 
The looking-while-listening (LWL) paradigm is frequently used to measure toddlers’ lexical processing efficiency (LPE). Children's LPE is associated with vocabulary size, yet other linguistic, cognitive, or social skills contributing to LPE are not well understood. It also remains unclear whether LPE measures from two types of LWL trials (target-initial versus distractor-initial trials) are differentially associated with the abovementioned potential correlates of LPE. We tested 18- to 24-month-olds and found that children's word learning on a fast-mapping task was associated with LPE measures from all trials and distractor-initial trials but not target-initial trials. Children's vocabulary and pragmatic skills were both associated with their fast-mapping performance. Executive functions and pragmatic skills were associated with LPE measures from distractor-initial but not target-initial trials. Hence, LPE as measured by the LWL paradigm may reflect a constellation of skills important to language development. Methodological implications for future studies using the LWL paradigm are discussed.

3. **Original study info.**
40 typically developing children took the LWL task, as well as an EF task and a fast-mapping task. Parents also filled in the CDI WS Short Form and the LUI. For LWL, 8 trials involved novel words (data not analysed in the paper, and not in the raw data), and 32 were vanilla trials involving familiar words, with targets unknown to the child excluded. Looking behaviour was recorded on video and coded offline frame-by-frame by a trained blind coder. 

4. **Importing decisions.**
Note that exclusions happened prior to raw data submission by the contributor; these included:
- English not being the primary language spoken at home;
- Target nouns not known by child;
- Child was fussy or distracted during a trial.
Distractor structure and AOIs were manually recoded based on the author's information. **Note that stimuli table has image paths but images are not present on OSF.**

5. **Importing ambiguity.**
Currently none.
