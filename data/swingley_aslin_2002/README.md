2. Abstract
The degree to which infants represent phonetic detail in
words has been a source of controversy in phonology and developmental psychology. One prominent hypothesis holds that infants store words
in a vague or inaccurate form until the learning of similar-sounding
neighbors forces attention to subtle phonetic distinctions. In the experiment reported here, we used a visual fixation task to assess word recognition. We present the first evidence indicating that, in fact, the lexical
representations of 14- and 15-month-olds are encoded in fine detail,
even when this detail is not functionally necessary for distinguishing
similar words in the infant’s vocabulary. Exposure to words is sufficient
for well-specified lexical representations, even well before the vocabulary spurt. These results suggest developmental continuity in infants’
representations of speech: As infants begin to build a vocabulary and
learn word meanings, they use the perceptual abilities previously demonstrated in tasks testing the discrimination and categorization of meaningless syllables.


3. Original study info
50 children were included in study. Each saw 28 trials -- 4 filler and 24 target. 
Target trials came in 3 flavors: 
 - cp (correct pronunciation), 
 - m-h (close mispronunciation),
 - m-e (far mispronunciation)
Type of mispronunciation was between subjects, all subjects saw CP trials. 

4. Importing decisions
Raw data appears to be post-exclusion to start with. 

We don't know the monitor size, but video was hand coded.

Filler trials look wonky -- there are fewer than we expect (expected 4 / kid - exclusions) and there are instead 1-3 per child (total of 76 / average of 1.5 for kids). Also the looking is *very* commonly to one of target or distractor for the entire time. (unlike the non-filler data which has a more expected distribution). This appears to come from the raw data. Our best guess is that some errors happened before the datafile were sent -- possible some lines got chopped out or some filling happened???


5. Importing ambiguity
Mispronounced stimuli coded as novel. See code for some notes about fixing some errors/inconsistencies in the original data files.
